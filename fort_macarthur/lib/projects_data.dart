  "Each had just one name -- Jim, Prince, Ruff, Bear.\nTogether they are believed to be the first of hundreds of four- legged soldiers to be trained, and killed, in the line of duty as part of the U.S. Army's 'K-9 Command' program at Ft. MacArthur in San Pedro. For decades they have lain buried, along with two dozen other valiant wartime dogs, behind the base chapel.\nThese fallen tail-wagging troops were the dogs of war: muscular Doberman pinschers, German shepherds and, for a time, some specially bred canines called GI dogs, trained for sentry duty and attack. 'Although the Army used sled dogs as early as 1913 for transportation' and delivering messages and supplies, 'Ft. MacArthur is believed to be the first base to use\ndogs as weapons,' said Steve Nelson, director of the Ft. MacArthur Museum, the centerpiece of Angels Gate Park.\nOn Sept. 9, 1941, Sgt. Robert H. Pearce put together a 'war dog' platoon at Ft. MacArthur. Its original purpose was to 'conserve manpower and strengthen the guard by giving sentries an added weapon,' according to the base newsletter. The K-9 Commandos would become progenitors of a new kind of attack dog -- bigger, stronger and smarter canine soldiers. Unlike other military dogs of the popular and publicized 'Dogs for Defense' program -- in which animals were taught to sniff out bombs and land mines, carry battlefield messages and scout trails -- the K-9 Commandos' training to guard and to kill remained pretty much under wraps until the end of the war. Records of their Army service are so spotty that it is uncertain whether they served overseas, and what they might have done there.\nThe dogs Pearce selected had to be aggressive, physically fit, between 1 and 3 years old, responsive to voice commands, not gun-shy and able to stand their ground without cowering. Many of them were tested and classified by Hollywood dog trainer Carl Spitz, who spent 20 years readying dogs for films and who also trained 'Dogs for Defense.' Among his movie-star pupils were Terry, the female Cairn terrier who played Dorothy's male dog, Toto, in 'The Wizard of Oz'; and Buck, one of the dogs used in the film of Jack London's 'The Call of the Wild.'\nBy January 1942, a month after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, newspaper stories and radio announcements were asking readers and listeners to volunteer their dogs for war duty. Hundreds of Angelenos showed up at Pershing Square, some with cocker spaniels and Boston terriers in tow.\nBruno, a 65-pound chow mix, was the first chosen for the K-9 Command program. Five other recruits, including a schnauzer and a German shepherd named Rin -- grandson of dog star Rin-Tin-Tin -- were commissioned on the spot, loaded in cages, and taken to Ft. MacArthur for training. One funny-looking dog, clearly not killer material, still found a home at the base. His owner, a San Pedro resident, dropped off the English bulldog at the base with 'pedigree papers, fleas and very little ambition,' the base newsletter reported. When he didn't make the cut, the bulldog was adopted by the Army staff and named Sgt. Mulligan, because he was always getting into the stew -- as in Mulligan stew, and that meant trouble. Eventually he became the base mascot.\n" +
      "\nFrom their training camp in San Pedro, the dogs were assigned to military bases here and possibly overseas. In 1943, the K-9 Command started a stud service for a new generation of canine gladiators, bred for size, intelligence and ferocity. Major was the biggest of the litter from a German shepherd and American pit bull terrier mix. He was as 'tall as a shepherd with a chest as broad as the average man's,' the base newsletter reported. Major was then bred with an Airedale named Maggie. Their three pups -- half Airedale, one-quarter German shepherd and one-quarter American pit bull terrier -- were named GI, OD and BC. Soon, they were isolated to ensure that they didn't pick up the habits of the other dogs, and to prevent Army personnel from petting them. When they were 4 months old, the three began training to respond to voice commands, to run obstacle courses, and to stalk and attack the enemy.  After peace came in 1945, the Army's K-9 Command unit went public. GI, OD and BC, along with another trio, Wolf, Cisco and Rin - - the one with Rin-Tin-Tin as his ancestor -- showed off their attack skills for an audience at the Ann Street animal shelter and at the Pan Pacific Auditorium in Los Angeles." +
      "\nDuring the Cold War, trained dogs were needed for sentry duty at 16 Nike missile sites that ringed Orange and Los Angeles counties. Ft. MacArthur was the headquarters for the bases. One of the four-footed soldiers was Brutus, a 95-pound German shepherd with his serial number, 737 alpha, tattooed in his ear. Brutus was trained at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio and transferred, along with his handler, Army Pvt. Paul Acosta, to the Malibu Nike missile site in 1970. Their assignment: to guard 18 nuclear warheads." +
      "\nAt the Malibu compound, a guard armed with a .45-caliber handgun was stationed at the entrance to the command and launch areas. Another armed guard and his dog patrolled an inner defensive perimeter. Brutus, Lothar, Cheetah and Fritz were known for their fearlessness, skill at finding trespassers and AWOL soldiers, and ability to discern the good guys from the bad. But life was not all work and no play. 'I played practical jokes on the security guards all the time, because the guards were so antagonistic toward Brutus,' Acosta said. 'They always threatened to shoot my dog if I ever let him off his leash. So one night I caught an off-duty guard sleeping and put a piece of bologna on his chest. Just to watch his face when he woke up and found Brutus, teeth bared, was worth a million bucks.'" +
      "\nIn the mid-1970s, the Nike sites were abandoned and the canines retired, but they would never know civilian life. The dogs were taken to Ft. MacArthur and put to death. A military policy, in effect since 1949, prohibited the dogs' adoption because they were trained to attack. That policy was rescinded in 2000, after years of campaigning by veterinarian William Putney of Woodland Hills.  Acosta testifies to Brutus' good heart." +
      "\n'Even though these dogs were trained to kill, they were very affectionate with their handlers,' he said. 'I could confide in Brutus things I could never tell my wife. 'When I got out of the Army,' he said, 'I got another German shepherd and named him Brutus. But there was really only one Brutus.' ",
  "For years, the Fort MacArthur Museum Association has vigorously campaigned for the preservation of the historic 'Hey Rookie' swimming pool on the Upper Reservation, commonly known as the 'Gaffey Street Pool'. The long-standing strategy was to prevent any severe modification or possible demolition of the site as sometimes was proposed." +
      "\nWe are pleased to be able to report that as of 2015, the 'Hey Rookie'/Gaffey Street Pool has received a new lease on life." +
      "\nFollowing is a message from the Fort MacArthur Museum director, Stephen Nelson." +
      "\n'Several years ago the Museum participated in a competitive grant program from the Port of LA at the urging of Dorothy Matich. The Museum won the grant for a total of 6.9 million dollars to create an adaptive reuse plan for the old 'Hey Rookie' pool, usually referred to as Gaffey Pool. The Museum Association  working on behalf of the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks, has helped make this project a reality. Many months of work by the Bureau of Engineering and dozens of other entities has yielded the plans and renderings illustrated below. We feel that this will be a huge improvement to the Upper Reservation Historic District and will be a real benefit to San Pedro. Ground Breaking is scheduled for February 5th, 2015 with completion scheduled for June 2016. We will post periodic construction images and updates. Hope you all can join us for an opening day dip.'" +
      "\nThis historic swimming pool was built through funds raised by proceeds from 'Hey Rookie,' a show produced and performed by members of the Fort MacArthur Garrison. The show was developed during the early years of World War II and was performed for men stationed at the remote gun batteries of the Harbor Defenses of Los Angeles in order to increase morale." +
      "\nThe 'Hey Rookie' show was an instant success and so popular that it was slated for public performances in 1942. After a few public venues, the show was selected to run at the Belasco Theater in downtown Los Angeles. The show remained at the Belasco for nine months when it was finally selected for performances overseas. The production was offered for troops in Africa, Italy and the China Burma India Theater of Operations. Many notable stars were associated with the show including the actor Sterling Holloway (the voice of Winnie-The-Pooh and countless Disney characters), J.C. Lewis from KHJ Radio, Tex Terry from Columbia Pictures and many other Hollywood personalities that found themselves in uniform during the Second World War." +
      "\nAfter the departure of the 'Hey Rookie' show for overseas duty, the swimming pool served the enlisted men of Fort MacArthur for recreational activities, and also served the new recruits that were processed at the Lower Reservation. During the war over 750,000 troops were processed through this Induction and Separation Center. Some of the new recruits did not know how to swim. Since the majority of these men were slated for overseas service via transport ship the pool became their first experience with swimming." +
      "\nThrough the clever thinking of the Fort MacArthur Service Command, Olympic swimmer Howard Ploessel was detailed to manage the Hey Rookie swimming pool. Ploessel and his wife, Velma (a silver medalist in the 1936 Berlin Olympics) began to develop new ways of using the swimming pool to boost morale and help the war effort. Together they developed special shows called Aquacades. Mrs. Ploessel was a physical education instructor at both the San Pedro and Huntington Park High Schools. She selected swimmers from her teams to serve as the performers for the Aquacades. The girls were soon known as the Southern California Aquabelles (SCA) and performed regularly as the main attraction at the pool. In similar fashion to the “Hey Rookie” show the Aquabelles became an instant hit and were performing throughout Southern California. The show was such a success that it became part of the war bond drive for the 7th War Loan." +
      "\nUpon the conclusion of the 7th War Loan, the Aquabelles were credited with assisting a drive that raised 26,000,000 dollars. The SCA Aquacades also had many VIP’s as participants with their various shows. Edward G. Robinson, Joan Blondell, Johnny Weissmuller, Stubby Krueger and Miss America 1943 were all participants with the Aquacades." +
      "\nIn addition to its historical significance the pool also has architectural significance as well, although this significance is greatly overshadowed by its historic significance. The pool is an example of mid-20th century modernism with stylistic details related to the Art Moderne style of the 1930s. It is markedly different from most swimming pools in its location, on a hillside, and that it was incorporated into a property used for military service." +
      "\nAfter the war, the pool continued to serve the troops of Fort MacArthur and the citizens of San Pedro. Later, the pool was opened to the public in addition to its military use. Special changing rooms and showers were constructed on its eastern side to accommodate the increased usage. Thousands of children used the pool during the 1950s, 60s and 70s." +
      "\nAs the decades passed, the 'Hey Rookie' show had regrettably faded from the public memory and the pool lost its signature name, and was now commonly called the Gaffey Street Pool. Regardless of its name, the pool continued to serve the public - even after the Army left the property in 1982, when it was turned over to the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks. The pool continued operating until the early 1990s when it was closed and drained." +
      "\nSince that time, the pool was all but forgotten, stripped of its fixtures, overgrown, and vandalized. Recent years have been hard on the 'Hey Rookie' Pool complex. A serious increase in vandalism caused a great deal of damage to the pool's tile surface and partially destroyed the building housing the civilian changing rooms that were built when the Army first started allowing public use of the pool in. Recently built fences, installed by the LAUSD, helped temporarily, but could never eliminate the problem of vandalism." +
      "\nWhile the damage is significant and disheartening, it can, and now, will be repaired." +
      "\nThe 'Hey Rookie' Pool will again be a positive experience and resource for the San Pedro community,  rallying back from being a neglected and almost forgotten nuisance to again serving future generations as a legacy of Fort MacArthur.",
  "Over the years, many people have asked me about the state of preservation and future plans of the wooden barracks buildings that dot the former Upper Reservation of Fort MacArthur. It has long been the policy of the Fort MacArthur Museum Association that these buildings should be preserved and interpreted in such a way that protects their unique architectural style and history." +
      "\nFor many veterans the barracks is the iconic example of their time in the service. It was the place where they lived, trained, and socialized. The barracks structures around the Upper Reservation are structures of unique design and character. The structures on the lower part of the property were constructed as part of the recruitment and mobilization program of the First World War. While only designed to be kept in service for the duration of that conflict, more than half of the buildings survive to this day and are used as classrooms and storage rooms by the Los Angeles Unified School District." +
      "\nBeginning in the fall of 1940, the United States began the first peacetime draft if civilians for service in the military. Each draftee was expected to serve just over a year. While the new inductees and sudden influx spending was a welcome change for the army, it was not fully ready to support the more than one-million men being drafted. Basic supplies such as uniforms and training materials had to be augmented by equipment that had been originally intended for WWI, this included housing. Early draftees slept in tents, but it soon became apparent that a more permanent solution would be necessary." +
      "\nThe barracks on the upper portion of the property are unique because of the time when they were built. Most of the buildings were built in the middle part of 1941, over a year before our nation was drawn into the Second World War. They were designed to provide housing and shelter for a new group of citizen soldiers that were drafted into the army for the first time in our history. The design of these building is not of the standard design that would be developed during the war. They are thought to be the only examples of their kind remaining in the United States and have features found in no other construction." +
      "\nIt has long been the contention by the Fort MacArthur Museum Association that these structures should be preserved and adaptively reused in such a way that preserves their history and unique architecture. All of them can be considered contributing resources to the two National Register Historic Sites in Angeles Gate Park and as well as the California State Historic District that was established by the hard work of our volunteers at Whites Point. Our organization was founded on the principal of protecting the history of Fort MacArthur and we do believe that a policy of adaptive reuse should be employed in a way that preserves the architectural and historical significance of the structures while still providing the necessary space needed by the other tenants of Angeles Gate. " +
      "\nWhile the Association does not at this time have the resources or access to provide the funding needed for proper stabilization or restoration of these buildings, other organizations that are today in control of the buildings do. The city of Los Angeles has held ownership of the structures since the army gifted the property to them and for the past thirty years, it has had a conditional use permit in place with the Angels Gate Cultural Center. The cultural center provides low or no-cost studio and exhibit space to artists and other cultural groups, and both groups have spent little or no money in that time to maintain the buildings.",
  "On June 27 1979 The Upper Reservation of Fort MacArthur was deeded to the City of Los Angeles. An eleven section agreement and understanding was incorporated into the deed. One of the important provisions of the deed is that the City of Los Angeles was to submit a detailed Master Plan for the development and use of the land within two years of the deed. The City of Los Angeles also agreed to preserve, protect and maintain the historical integrity of the Osgood-Farley Battery, a property listed on the National Register of Historic Places." +
      "\nAs of today, the City of Los Angeles has failed to comply with either of these provisions of the deed. The Department seems to have confused the environmental review process with the master plan process. The sole document 'proving' the existence of a 'Master Plan' is a map that was incorporated in the 1990 Negative Declaration prepared for Phase II of Angel's Gate Park. A map that fails to indicate that there is a 20 acre National Register Site in the park! In 1995, Department planners were still unaware that there was a National Register Site in the park." +
      "\nThe Fort MacArthur Museum Association nominated Battery Osgood-Farley for the list of Historic Cultural Monuments. The Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission designated Battery Osgood-Farley as site No. 515 in 1991. In spite of the provisions of the deed and federal and local historic landmark designations, Battery Osgood-Farley remains under attack." +
      "\nThe Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission approved a Korean War Memorial directly in front of Battery Osgood-Farley, amazingly, within the boundaries of Site No. 515, and the City of Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks built the 1.5 million dollar Joan Milke Flores Park within the boundaries of the National Register Site without any proper review by the State Historic Preservation Office or the National Park Service." +
      "\nEvery two years the City of Los Angeles reports on their 'progress' in Angel's Gate Park to the National Park Service in San Francisco. For years the Park Service has been aware that there is no Master Plan for the park. Some of the City's reports to the Park Service contain reports of developments never completed." +
      "\nIn 1995, staff of the local Councilman's office were made aware of the serious problems in Angel's Gate Park. The Councilman's office responded by transferring certain Department of Recreation and Parks staff from Angel's Gate Park, creating the position of Historic Site Curator for the Osgood-Farley Historic Site, and calling for resumes for a new committee to create a Master Plan for the park. As of this date, the committee only exists on paper and has never actually had a formal meeting. The city remains in violation of the provisions of the deed." +
      "\nAs of February, 1998, Phil Orland, Director of Angel's Gate Park is again talking about bulldozing historic buildings on the old Upper Reservation of Fort MacArthur. The Los Angeles City Department of Parks and Recreation seems to have little understanding or appreciation of Federal and State historical preservation laws and the proper procedures for dealing with historic properties. It appears that the Department of Recreation and Parks in the largest city in California has no staff with any formal training in historic preservation." +
      "\nThe establishment of a real Master Plan for Angels Gate Park would be an important first step in protecting the many historical assets of the Harbor Defenses of Los Angeles from the Department of Recreation and Parks unceasing attacks. A Master Plan could incorporate a historic district that would bring together together all of the existing sites relating to the Harbor Defenses of Los Angeles. This project requires skills in research, photography, and writing. There are approximately100 buildings on the Upper Reservation to document. This project may require a grant to hire a company that specializes in this kind of work." +
      "\nThis is a high priority project for the association, as the elements of the Harbor Defenses of Los Angeles are being destroyed at an alarming rate.",
  "On August 11, 2000 Fort MacArthur Museum Association members Frank Evans and Sam Stokes successfully argued the merits of listing both Battery Bunker and the NIKE LA43L site on the California register of Historic Places During the meeting of the California State Historic Resources Commission in San Luis Obispo. Both sites at White's Point is now officially a listed historic resource. But we aren't out of the woods yet." +
      "\nThe Department of Recreation and Parks STILL wants to demolish the Nike site. This, despite the great effort of the recently formed Los Angeles Air Defense Museum Association to work with the department to find a solution that would satisfy all the parties concerned with the site. Battery Bunker is far too costly to remove, as are the underground NIKE magazines, or those would also be on their list to destroy.",
  "Beginning in the 1920's, these small concrete 'bunkers' were built in several groupments on the Upper Reservation, Point Fermin, White Point, Sea Bench and at Point Vicente. These stations were located  some distance from their respective emplacements along a measured base line. During World War II additional fire control stations were constructed for the new weapons then under construction to protect the harbor. These structures are technically known as base-end stations, although they are some times called fire control stations, observation stations or fire control bunkers. They are often mistaken for 'pill boxes' or machine gun positions." +
      "\nBase-end stations contained various optical instruments for making observations of the target.  The standard issue for Coast Artillery was the Model 1910A1 azimuth telescope which was used to determine horizontal angles of the azimuth to the target from the base-end station. A second and much more complex instrument was the depression position finder (DPF). The DPF was used to determine the vertical azimuth of the target from the base-end station. Azimuth telescopes were mounted on concrete columns, depression range finders were mounted on large eight sided concrete bases." +
      "\nOver the years, these stations have disappeared when found to be in the way of various developments.  Some have been destroyed by the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks without any review or permit process. Others have been destroyed by the Air Force for their new housing project at White Point.  Now remaining sites are in scheduled for destruction for several golf courses in the Rancho Palos Verdes area. The Fort MacArthur Museum Association is exploring the possibility of securing the sites and placing interpretative signs at the sites. It may be too late to save more of these small but valuable elements of the Harbor Defenses of Los Angeles." +
      "\nThe Fort MacArthur Museum and the San Pedro Bay Historical Society made a joint effort to save some of the 1920's era fire control stations at White Point.  We were partially successful. One World War I era fire control station will be preserved in place. The Battery Commander's station for Battery Bunker will be preserved in place, and one of the World War I era fire control station will be moved off its base line and restored for viewing.",
  "If you look carefully as you walk along the trails of the Bolsa Chica wetlands reserve in Huntington beach, you might stumble across the two large concrete Panama style mounts for two of Fort MacArthur's southern most batteries." +
      "\nThe area has been fenced because of a re-vegetation program in the area. The reader board in the background presents information about the gun mounts." +
      "\nFor more information about the restoration and interpretation programs at this location, the Bolsa Chica Stewards meet the 2nd Saturday of each month at the trailer across from the fire station at Pacific Coast Highway and Warner. Call (714) 969-7229"

  "The 1942 60' GE Searchlight and Sperry generator have arrived safely from Texas. Overall, both units are in good shape but need to be restored to working order. Neither the light or the power unit have seen use in some time. The good news is that many of the hard to find parts are already with the units." +
      "\nWere raising the money to fund the purchase of the remaining parts and the cost of painting the light will be high. The first step is to remove the hideous pink colored pint that was added when the light was used by an advertising business. This process has to be done 'the old fashioned way', with a sharp chisel because of the thin metal work and the desire to keep some of the original olive-drab paint as both a primer and added layer of protection for some of the metal pieces." +
      "\nThe association wishes to thank Bob Meza of Victory Searchlights for his help finding the light and some of the hard to find parts. We also thank the veterans and families of the 352nd CA Searchlight Battalion who's generosity helped make this acquisition possible. Once restored, these will compliment the museums fully restored 1941 Sperry Searchlight and GE Generator." +
      "\nThe Searchlights are an critical part of our educational program, and bring the museum much positive publicity. As with any project of this size and complexity, the museum seriously needs restoration and maintenance funding. We encourage anyone interested in searchlights to donate to the efforts of our restoration team.",
  "Not all of our project require heavy lifting and hundreds of man-hours to restore. From time-to-time its nice to take a break and do some detail work on some of the artifacts collected by the museum over the years." +
      "\nThe time-interval bell in the gun pit is just one component in the larger fire control timing system. In order to keep all the target spotters, plotting room personnel and gun crews operating at the same pace, a series of bells were connected to a clock like device that chimed a series of rings every thirty seconds. The purpose of this system was to act as a sort of pulse by which all components in the fire control system operated." +
      "\nA bell was placed in the gun pit to let the gun crew know when the next command to fire was supposed to be executed." +
      "\nWhile the museum has managed to salvage two of the original cases for the pit bells, both have seen considerable ware and neglect over the years. In fact the bell cover in the Battery Osgood pit, has no less than three bullet holes in it." +
      "\nThe restoration process began by removing the galvanized steel cover from the cast-iron backplane, and removing the four nuts that held the box to the parapet wall. After the pieces were removed, the wooden board that mounted the actual bell inside the box was found to be in such bad condition that it just fell apart in my hands. Luckily, I was able to get measurements so I could fabricate a replacement." +
      "\nNow that all the pieces were separated, it was a simple matter to media-blast all the metal parts to remove any rust and corrosion, minor sheet-metal work was done to the cover and two coats of automotive primer and high-gloss black pain applied. This should mimic the original finish as much as possible." +
      "\nNow it was off to the computer to search for a suitable replacement bell. From measuring the inside of the cover I was able to determine that the maximum size bell that could fit in the case was about six inches. A vintage bell, similar to the type originally mounted was obtained from our old friend eBay." +
      "\n\nCheck back soon for future updates, this is an ongoing project.",
  "The light being restored was purchased in Santa Rosa California. The light and generator had been sitting in a field probably for over 10 years. Putting this unit back in operation has been a rewarding challenge to the restoration crew here at Fort MacArthur." +
      "\nThe light came pretty much intact, but a few very important parts were missing. The burner inside the light needed to be totally rebuilt. The carbon feed mechanism had frozen due to rust. The generator for this light should be a Sperry Searchlight Generator, but what we ended up with was a General Electric Searchlight Generator." +
      "\nThis unit was just as complete as the light, but it too was in need of a few important parts, like the distributor, and the battery charging generator. It was later found that after sitting so long, the generator's Hercules JXD 6 cylinder engine had frozen up, and would not turn over." +
      "\nAfter two years of intense work, the Sperry Searchlight was finally brought back to an in-service condition by the skilled work of our volunteers in time for its début at the 2003 Old Fort MacArthur Days event. since that time, the light has been used to announce the various special events at the museum. This has been a great way to promote awareness of the museum.",
  "Late last year, museum carpenter Ralph Medina began work on an exciting new project to replace the windows on the exterior of all the rooms throughout Battery Osgood-Farley. Over the years, many of the original windows had been damaged due to vandalism, and exposure to the elements. Many attempts have been made over they years to produce replica windows with limited success. The old replica windows and some of the surviving originals had their glass plains replaced by plywood or painted to conceal the glass from would be vandals, giving the rooms of the battery a very dark look from the inside." +
      "\nThe new windows are being constructed using a mix of original and replacement material and the replacement glass is about as close as we can find through modern glass inventory. For security reasons, the new glass is media blasted in the museum shop prior to installation. This process allows the light to shine through the glass while at the same time blocking any direct view of interior rooms. So far Ralph has managed to complete and mount three out of the ten sets. During the process, the window sills and frames are also being restored in a way that is sympathetic to the existing historical fabric."
